Using this for your own profile is **easy!**


- Simply take a template of the repository
- Rename the new repo it created on your GitHub account to GitHub username

So, the name of my repository is "Itz-Hyperz" because my GitHub username is "Itz-Hyperz"


So, simply template it, and rename it, then edit the Markdown file called "README.md" to your liking, and to match your info / personality.

Happy Coding :smiley:
